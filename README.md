Viral marketing is a business tactic that primarily leverages social media platforms to advertise a product on already-existing social networks. Its name alludes to the manner in which customers share information about a product with others, much like a virus does from one person to another. Businesses look for customers that want to consume less advertising and are willing to pay their influencers more. Market studies find that influencer selection affects the personality of a product and that it needs to be carried out properly.
Viral marketing has become an increasingly influential and powerful trend in the world of marketing. This form of marketing relies on creating and spreading content that captures the attention of the masses, prompting them to share it with their own networks. A key element of viral marketing is the utilization of social media platforms, where the reach and potential for content to go viral are immense. In recent years, the analysis of viral marketing trends has become crucial for businesses to stay ahead in a highly competitive market. Companies are closely monitoring viral content, examining the characteristics that make it successful, and leveraging those insights to develop their own viral campaigns. 

The proposed system for dynamics of viral marketing trend analysis utilizes datasets from TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram to provide advertisers with valuable insights. 
By examining trends and patterns in the data, advertisers can determine where to invest their resources, tailoring their content for specific platforms. Additionally, the system assists in influencer selection, distinguishing between influencers based on their authentic engagement rates. This approach enables advertisers to make informed decisions, optimizing their viral marketing strategies for maximum impact and ensuring their campaigns reach the right audience through the most effective channels.
